# osu-downloader
A browser extension that auto-downloads [no-video] beatmaps once you visit a beatmap download page.

# Usage
* Let it run :)
* It will automatically start downloading a beatmap once the page is fully loaded.
* The download folder is called `osu-songs-symlink`, which must be located in the default download location.
* As you probably guessed, if `osu-songs-symlink` is a symlink to the osu folder it will automatically get there.
* F5 inside osu!

>It's like a free low poly osu-direct
