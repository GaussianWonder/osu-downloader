# osu-downloader
A browser extension that auto-downloads [no-video] beatmaps once you visit a beatmap download page.

# Usage
* Let it run :)
* It will automatically start downloading a beatmap once the page is fully loaded.
* The download folder is called `osu-songs-symlink`, which must be located in the default download location.
* As you probably guessed, if `osu-songs-symlink` is a symlink to the osu folder it will automatically get there.
* F5 inside osu!

>It's like a free low poly osu-direct

# Tips and Tricks
* Use the middle click to spawn beatmaps in separate windows, the extension will do the work

# TODO
>A list of things i want to complete before publishing it on formus & chrome extension store
* List of currently downloading beatmaps
* Progress bar for each downloading item inside the list
* Close the window after the download finishes
* Add settings fields for each new feature (if applicable)

# Close to impossible TODO list
>Sadly it might be a limitation that comes with chrome extensions
* Possibly extend this to magically work with beatmap packs
